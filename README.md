just a draft, mainly for "personal" use
# what it does
copy a directory (a symfony2 one for example)
create a new db with a new user with privileges on it
duplicate a base (certainly the one used by the directory copied) into the new one
clean logs/access.log and logs/error.log of the new dir
edit app/config/parameters.yml with the new db datas
duplicate and modify the site on /etc/apache2/sites-avaible and enable it (the site must have the same name as the dir)
cache:clear and asset stuff

# use
clone this repo
copy the .sh file to /var/www/ or cd ~/htdocs or ....
cd /var/www/ or cd ~/htdocs or ....
sh ./duplicate_domain.sh
enjoy
